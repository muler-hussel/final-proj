### Major Landmarks
1. **Eiffel Tower**: An iconic symbol of Paris, it’s a must-visit for breathtaking views.
2. **Louvre Museum**: Home to masterpieces like the Mona Lisa; try to allocate a good few hours here.
3. **Notre-Dame Cathedral**: Though it's under restoration, visiting the area is still worthwhile for its history and architecture.
  
### Hidden Gems
1. **Musée de l'Orangerie**: A smaller art museum featuring Monet's Water Lilies.
2. **Parc des Buttes-Chaumont**: A beautiful park less frequented by tourists, perfect for a picnic.
3. **La Promenade Plantée**: An elevated park that runs along an old railway track, offering a unique walking experience.

### Dining Options
1. **Le Comptoir de la Gastronomie**: A well-loved bistro known for traditional French cuisine.
2. **Chez Janou**: Charming spot serving Provencal dishes and known for its luscious chocolate mousse.
3. **L’As du Fallafel**: Famous for some of the best falafel in the Marais district, worth visiting for a quick bite.

### Transportation Options

- **Buses**: Great for sightseeing; they allow you to see the city while you travel.
- **Walking**: Many attractions are close together, making walking a pleasant option.

I'll compile all this information into a well-rounded plan for your trip. Is there anything specific you want me to adjust or include?

Here are some lesser-known museums in Paris that I think you'll find fascinating:

### Lesser-Known Museums in Paris
1. **Musée Jacquemart-André**: A stunning mansion filled with art collections gathered by Édouard André and Nélie Jacquemart during the 19th century, showcasing works from the Italian Renaissance.

2. **Musée de la Vie Romantique**: Dedicated to the Romantic era, this small museum features works of art, literature, and the romantic life of the 19th century, along with a charming garden café.

3. **Musée Zadkine**: Tucked away near the Luxembourg Gardens, this museum is dedicated to the works of sculptor Ossip Zadkine. The garden around the museum adds an extra touch of tranquility.

4. **Musée Marmottan Monet**: Home to an extensive collection of Impressionist paintings, particularly those by Claude Monet, this is often overlooked and offers a more intimate experience than the Louvre.

5. **Musée des Arts Forains**: An enchanting museum that showcases a collection of “fairground” art and antique carnival attractions, offering guided tours that provide insight into the history of entertainment.

6. **Musée des Égoïstes**: A unique museum focused on individualism, this small space highlights the works of various artists who went against the norm, providing an intriguing look at self-expression.

7. **Musée de l'Automobile**: Also known as the Schlumpf Collection, this museum features an impressive assortment of classic cars, ranging from the rarest automobiles to vintage vehicles, located in Mulhouse but worth a day trip.

Here’s a revised 5-day itinerary that focuses on more secluded locations and experiences:

### 5-Day Iceland Itinerary (Less Crowded)

#### Day 1: Arrival in Reykjavik
- **Morning:** Arrive in Reykjavik. Settle into your accommodation.
- **Afternoon:** Explore the quieter parts of Reykjavik, such as the **Árbær Open Air Museum**, which showcases Icelandic history in a peaceful outdoor setting.
- **Evening:** Enjoy dinner at a local restaurant away from the busy city center, such as **Kopar** or **Fiskfélagið**.

#### Day 2: Golden Circle (Off the Beaten Path)
- **Morning:** Visit **Þingvellir National Park** early in the day to avoid crowds. Explore the less-traveled trails and enjoy the stunning rift valley.
- **Afternoon:** Instead of the popular Gullfoss, visit **Bruarfoss**, known for its striking blue water. It’s a bit of a hike to get there but well worth it for the solitude and beauty.
- **Evening:** Return to Reykjavik and enjoy a quiet evening stroll along the **Harbour** area.

#### Day 3: South Coast Exploration
- **Morning:** Head to **Seljalandsfoss**, but arrive early to beat the crowds. Afterward, visit **Gljúfrabúi**, a hidden waterfall nearby that is often overlooked.
- **Afternoon:** Explore the **Sólheimasandur Plane Wreck**. It requires a bit of walking (about 4 km each way), but you’ll likely have the area to yourself.
- **Evening:** Stay overnight in a nearby guesthouse or cabin, such as **Hotel Skogafoss**, which is less crowded than major hotels.

#### Day 4: Vatnajökull National Park
- **Morning:** Take a guided glacier hike on **Sólheimajökull Glacier**. Opt for a smaller group tour for a more personal experience.
- **Afternoon:** Visit **Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon**, a stunning but less-visited site, perfect for a peaceful hike along the canyon's edge.
- **Evening:** Head to **Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon** for a quieter experience, especially at sunset. The nearby **Diamond Beach** is also less crowded in the evening.

#### Day 5: Snæfellsjökull National Park
- **Morning:** Drive to **Snæfellsjökull National Park**. Explore the **Djúpalónssandur Beach** and the surrounding areas, which are often less frequented by tourists.
- **Afternoon:** Hike to **Lóndrangar** and **Saxhóll Crater** for breathtaking views without the crowds.
- **Evening:** Return to Reykjavik for your last night. Consider a quiet dinner at a local eatery away from the main tourist spots.

### Additional Tips:
- **Travel Off-Peak:** Consider visiting during shoulder seasons (late spring or early fall) to avoid crowds.
- **Accommodation:** Look for guesthouses, cabins, or Airbnb options in rural areas to experience Iceland away from the hustle and bustle.
- **Transportation:** Renting a car gives you the flexibility to explore at your own pace and choose less-traveled routes.

This itinerary offers a blend of adventure and tranquility, allowing you to experience Iceland's natural beauty without the crowds. Let me know if you need more details or adjustments!
