  - RESEARCH_SPECIFIC_ITEM: For researching a specific type of item (e.g., "restaurants", "hotels", "transport").

  Based on the current session state, any new user input, or explicit user actions, you must determine the optimal to-do list and the exact step the planning process should be on.

  **Current Session State:**
  User ID: {user_id}
  Session ID: {session_id}
  Current Slots: {slots}
  Current To-Do List: {current_todo_list} (list of strings, indexed from 0)
  Current Step Index: {current_step_index} (index of the step currently being worked on)
  Conversation History: {user_input}
  Classified Intent: {intent}

  **Rules for To-Do List Adjustment & Step Determination:**
  1.  **Always include:** "- Draft a detailed itinerary." and "- Finalize itinerary document for user." as the final steps.
  2.  **Research & Presentation:**
      * "Research potential destinations." and "Research attractions in [Destination]." are AI-driven, AI should automatically advance through these.
      * **Follow these with**: "Present initial destination/attraction ideas to the user." (`type`: PRESENT_IDEAS)
    - EXCEPTION: Only if the `intent` is **ITINERARY_GENERATION** or **FINALIZE_DOCUMENT**, skip the PRESENT_IDEAS step entirely, `final_step_index` jump directly to the corresponding step.  
  3.  **Refinement Loop:**
      * If the `intent` is "MORE_RECOMMENDATIONS", the `final_step_index` should STAY on "REFINE_SUGGESTIONS" to provide more options.
  4.  **Generate Itinerary:**
      * If the `intent` is "ITINERARY_GENERATION", the `final_step_index` should immediately jump to "DRAFT_ITINERARY".
  5.  **Mid-flow Changes/Interruptions:**
      * If `intent` is "MODIFY_PLAN", the entire `todo_list` might need to be regenerated from scratch, and the `current_step_index` reset appropriately (e.g., back to research for the new destination). The `final_step_index` will be the first user-facing step after the re-evaluation (e.g., "Present initial destination/attraction ideas to the user.").
      * If `intent` is "GENERAL_QUERY", the `todo_list` might not change, but the `current_step_index` might need to be temporarily paused or maintained while the AI answers the question out-of-band. The `final_step_index` would simply be the current_step_index as no planning progression occurred.

  Always output a JSON object with three keys:
  new_todo_list: An array of objects with two keys: "type", "description".
  new_current_step_index: An integer representing the 0-based index of the step that should be executed NEXT.
  final_step_index: The smallest index in `new_todo_list` that marks the **end of an automated reasoning/execution phase**.
    - For example: after auto-research, `final_step_index` should point to `PRESENT_IDEAS` if there is `PRESENT_IDEAS`; or if user show intention of ITINERARY_GENERATION, to `DRAFT_ITINERARY`.

  Example JSON output:
  ```json
  {{
    "new_todo_list": [
      {{"type": "DRAFT_ITINERARY", "description": "Draft a detailed itinerary."}},
