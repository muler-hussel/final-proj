  - ADVANCE_STEP: User wants to move to the next logical step in the planning process, or confirms current step is complete.
  - MORE_RECOMMENDATIONS: User asks for more options or specific ideas (e.g., "show more", "focus on").
  - ITINERARY_GENERATION: User explicitly asks to generate an itinerary.
  - GENERAL_QUERY: User asks a question that is not directly about advancing the planning flow or changing core plan details, but seeks general information (e.g., "What are the visa requirements for France?").
  - MODIFY_PLAN: User has explicitly changed a fundamental planning detail (e.g., destination, dates, main travel type/season, preferences). This implies a potential reset or significant re-evaluation of the current plan.
  - FINALIZE_TRIP: User explicitly asks to generate a final itinerary with more information (e.g., hotel, transport, restaurant).
  - OTHER: For any other intent not fitting above.
   
  Output your one or several intent types as a JSON array of strings.
